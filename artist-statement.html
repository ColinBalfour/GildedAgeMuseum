							<p>The Gilded Age, a time in American history that was golden on
								the outside but rotten on the inside, began around the 1870s and
								ended around 1900. Riding off the high of the civil war, America
								was becoming a rising power. Fast. A strong government presence
								and high-spirited citizens promoted growth and the expansion of
								industries. The new hype surrounding America captured
								foreigners’ attention, drawing many to the growing country.
								However, it was not all sunshine and rainbows. There was little
								value placed on individualism, and while the country thrived
								many people did not. The Gilded Age was a time period of
								exploiting individuals while public morale turned against easy
								targets without targeting root issues. </p>

							<p>Large corporations and business managers exploited workers for
								profit. Many unsafe business practices went unlooked due to
								corruption and the wealth in these new industries. Immigrants
								were rapidly coming into the country, providing an easy outlet
								to blame. Cities were overcrowded and densely populated with
								poor living conditions. </p>

							<h3>Industrialization</h3>

							<p>The goal of the industrialization page is to show its effect on
								the workers of the time and how it has created a standard of
								living that lasts even today. Chaplin’s piece was chosen to
								demonstrate the absurdity of how people were being treated, from
								the lens of a society that had begun to realize the issues that
								this industrialization caused. </p>

							<p>Frederick Taylor was a staple in this movement. While he was
								not trying to cause any damage and his ideas were a fantastic
								theory, the ways those ideas caught on were less than
								satisfactory. It promoted this mandated working experience that
								gave employers new power, which they would soon abuse.</p>

							<p>The problems we now attribute to industrialization were noticed
								back then too, but for so long we turned a blind eye. It’s
								difficult for us to understand how much we truly knew, and it is
								seldom taught. Frank Kimball’s lecture in the Bulletin of the
								Essex Institute is an amazing look into the issues that were
								really going on at the time and the extent to which scientists
								were aware. It’s astounding the impacts that industrialization
								had on civilization in such a short time. </p>

							<p>Yet despite all this, as we know it today, nothing was really
								done. Most of these issues went unchecked for a long while and
								some still remain in our society. </p>

							<h3>Immigration</h3>

							<p>The goal of the immigration page is to show not only the impact
								that the new faces had on America but also the impact that
								America had on them. How they were treated and how they were
								used speaks volumes to the society of the time. The Unstoppable
								Boy is an example of immigrants’ pure desperation to enter the
								country. </p>

							<p>Frank Leslie’s work aimed at the discrimination faced by some
								trying to enter. The Chinese were often looked down upon by
								Americans. Many thought they were taking jobs and ruining
								American lives. This growing disdain led to them being barred
								from entering the country. Leslie demonstrates how despite
								providing America with genuinely great things, they were cast
								out. America’s political enemies were all fine, but not the
								Chinese. It displays how unfair immigrants were treated.</p>

							<p>“The New Colossus” featured on the statue of liberty is a great
								testimony to what America ‘symbolized’. They put on a show of
								liberty and freedom, being able to create a better life. In
								reality, this was not always true. These feelings were quickly
								retracted in the coming years and often left immigrants
								scrambling around. </p>

							<p>The Gilded Age created a lasting impact on these immigrants and
								their families. Some of the class struggles faced today by
								minorities are largely due to the massive disdain created
								towards immigrants during this time.</p>
