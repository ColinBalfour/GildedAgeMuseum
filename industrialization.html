                <h3>A New Way of Life</h3>
                <p>Fully forming in the late 1800s, there was a push for
									industrialization. The economy of the US was rapidly
									transforming from agriculture to manufacturing. This spurred a
									revolution of factory jobs with assembly lines for mass
									production. Along with this came an influx of people who were
									happy to work these factory jobs. Workers of the time were
									often exploited by the factory owners as they squeezed out
									every last bit of profit.</p>

                <h3>Charlie Chaplin's <i>Modern Times</i></h3>
                <p>Charlie Chaplin’s <i>Modern Times</i> in 1936 (image above)
									was a both hilarious and profound look into some of the issues
									with the new work lifestyle prevalent throughout the Gilded
									Age. Charlie Chaplin was a famed comedian of the time, and
									wanted to shed light on some of the issues with the new age.
									He depicted a worker who could not control his own impulses:
									unable to leave the assembly line without continuing the same
									motions. Chaplin demonstrates how workers had mandated and
									rote jobs to such an extreme that it was all they knew how to
									do.</p>

  											<h3>Scientific Management & Taylorism</h3>
  											<p>In 1911, Frederick Taylor wrote his influential
													<b>“Scientific Management”.</b> In this, he described
													a new management system, based on the
													<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" target="_blank">
														scientific method.
													</a>
													Workers would be tested with different methods to find
													which is the optimal performance. Optimal motions,
													tools, carrying weight; <b> anything he could think of
													was tested and optimized.</b> Managers were also
													<i>supposed to</i> have the same jobs as workers to
													ensure the process works. </p>

  											<h3>Climate Effects</h3>
  											<p>In the
													<a href="essex-bulletin.html" target="_blank">
														Bulletin of the Essex Institute Vol. 18
													</a>
													(published in Salem, MA - 1886), a section <i>“The
													Climatology of the United States”</i> was written from
													a lecture given by Frank R. Kimball. He makes some
													very interesting points that seem way ahead of the time
													(from my understanding) - synonymous to the worldview
													today. Many odd weather patterns were starting to
													occur throughout the 1880s: <b>“We have had cold rainy
													Aprils more like November, with a few instances of
													unseasonable heat” (Bulletin 48).</b>
													Not only were there strange occurrences
													in weather, but also <b>“The prevalence of droughts and
													floods”. “In a deforested region, the effect…[is
													produced] by the water reaching the streams more
													rapidly” (Bulletin 49).</b></p>

  										<h3>The Lasting Change on Civilization</h3>

											<p>While this all seems great on the surface, in practice
												it left workers vulnerable to be exploited by management.
												There were little precautions for worker rights and
												health. Workers could no longer find pleasure in their
												jobs, because a <b>repetitive and optimized routine
												leaves no room for expression.</b>
												<a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/america-at-work-and-leisure-1894-to-1915/articles-and-essays/america-at-work/" target="_blank">
													Working conditions continued to plummet
												</a>
												throughout the Gilded Age, depriving people of their
												needs with no intention to change.</p>

  										<p>It is clear that there were prevalent climate issues in
												the late 1800s, exacerbated by industrialization and the
												pollution and environmental damage it caused. As stated
												by Kimball, <b> “The climate of a country has a greater
												influence upon the health and prosperity of the people
												than is generally realized” (Bulletin 15). </b> The
												deforestation was at such an extreme due to the
												increasing industrialization that
												<a href="https://vtdigger.org/2018/07/15/green-mountains-not-green/" target="_blank">
													 Vermont was stripped of almost all harvestable trees.
												</a> This caused many problems, including droughts and
												floods (as mentioned by Kimball) heavily impacting the
												lives of citizens. Not much was done about the
												increasing problems with the climate, which as we know
												today is a global issue. </p>

  										<p>The impact of the new factories was not unknown at the
												time, either.
												<a href="media/GlobalWarming_1896.pdf" target="_blank">
													In 1896 Svante Arrhenius wrote an article
												</a>
												on the influence of CO2 emissions. Arrhenius’ work
											 explained that halving the CO2 could drop the Earth’s
											 temperature by 4-5°C. Despite this, nothing was done.
											 The issues then are even more of a concern today due to
											 its effect on global warming.</p>
